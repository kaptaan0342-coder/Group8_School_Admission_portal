                <p>
                    In 1979, Lahore Grammar School opened its doors to a handful of students with 55 Main established as its first branch. We’ve come a long way since then! From the very beginning, however, the philosophy of the school has been to combine collaborative learning, critical and logical thinking skills and a diverse co-curricular program to help create a more balanced, well-rounded individual, with interests and ideas, a questioning mind and a genuine love for learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Lahore Grammar School provides education to girls till A Level. It has extended its network to cater to the needs of the middle income group in its Landmark Schools. LGS has branches in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Gujrat. It offers quality education to the low-income group through the Lahore Education Society School, entirely supported and funded by LGS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, please note that this website caters only to schools under the stewardship of Director and Principal, Mrs. Nasrene Shah- namely LGS 31 FCC, LGS 30 Main and LGS 55 Main.
