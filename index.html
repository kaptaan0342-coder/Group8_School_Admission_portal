                <p>
                    In 1979, Lahore Grammar School opened its doors to a handful of students with 55 Main established as its first branch. We’ve come a long way since then! From the very beginning, however, the philosophy of the school has been to combine collaborative learning, critical and logical thinking skills and a diverse co-curricular program to help create a more balanced, well-rounded individual, with interests and ideas, a questioning mind and a genuine love for learning. Today, Lahore Grammar School provides education to girls till A Level. It has extended its network to cater to the needs of the middle income group in its Landmark Schools. LGS has branches in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Gujrat. It offers quality education to the low-income group through the Lahore Education Society School, entirely supported and funded by LGS. However, please note that this website caters only to schools under the stewardship of Director and Principal, Mrs. Nasrene Shah- namely LGS 31 FCC, LGS 30 Main and LGS 55 Main.

We have effectively led education in the country through our quality education framework, diverse events and unparalleled facilities. Lahore Grammar School has consistently provided an enriching learning environment through special syllabi designed to promote real life skills that can generate intellectual ideas that have real world application. Today, Lahore Grammar School stands as one of the market leaders in education throughout the country, with a wide network of branches that successfully operate in all major cities nationwide. We are now entering the international arena with the aim that our next global generation needs exceptional academic and intellectual creativity to take on the positions of leadership and address the many challenges that the world is facing.

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is a holistic and dynamic one that appreciates diversity and stresses the importance of opinions based on rational and informed premises rather that on superstition, emotion and insufficient understanding of issues. Emphasis is laid on creating a culture of thinking in the classroom and education is seen as a broad and complex process of acquiring both knowledge and understanding. We aspire to make our students aware of contemporary issues, both national and worldwide, and their personal role not only in developing an understanding of these issues but prompting a desire to translate that knowledge into active commitment and take steps, where possible, to bring about positive change in their environment. We have taken several initiatives in the field of education in Pakistan, including the promotion of the performing arts which we felt were being neglected at great cost to our cultural tradition and a healthier social milieu. LGS also lays great emphasis on the teaching of regional languages so that our students develop an appreciation of their cultural roots and in the rich traditions of literature and music of their province. We take great pride in the fact that community service is a critical element of our programme, where our students are encouraged to share their skills and learn from the courage and resilience of those less fortunate than themselves.
